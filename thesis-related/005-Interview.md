# 005-Interview

**Researcher:** [00:00:00] Okay. Uh, what were your first impressions of the prototype system? 

**P5:** Um, the first impression of this prototype system, I think, um, the color design is good, is a chatting and, um, like there's two main options to choose. And it will probably like let people feel, have interest to do because the, all the text on the system is an action.

So just click start and the user will start a journey as, yeah. 

**Researcher:** Okay. Yes. And, um, so how, and for how long did you learn to, to use the protest system within the session? Um, do you [00:01:00] think you'll need someone to help you for the first time using the system? Um,

**P5:** yeah, I think, um, it might take me like, uh, 10 minutes to. Learn to how to use this prototype, and I think it'll be better, um, for, for the first time, uh, to use the system. If someone can, um, help me, that will be because, uh, um,

for the next step, like for the first time, maybe the user have no idea, um, how this, uh, system. Like run? Um, yeah, it would be better, 

**Researcher:** I think. Um, maybe some kind of tutorial, like a page of 

**P5:** or, or video tutorial [00:02:00] could be good. 

**Researcher:** Okay. Yeah. Yeah. To show the whole process. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. 

**P5:** Yeah. Video tutorial could be good.

Yeah. 

**Researcher:** Okay. Uh, what do you feel you achieve with the prototype? What do you feel I achieve? Um.

**P5:** I feel I was kind of like, uh, connect the music, the nose with the system. Um, I remember the correspond mode under the correspond. I feel like there's like some kind of the good music feedback after I just play my music. 

**Researcher:** Okay. 

**P5:** Yeah. 

**Researcher:** Uh, what do you like most about the system? 

**P5:** Um,

the system. So including the hardware? 

**Researcher:** Yes. Including the hardware. Yeah, 

**P5:** including the hardware. I, I like, uh, like the [00:03:00] hardware system, the, the media, uh, media control, um, piano here. Um, feel really great and also. Uh, as I mentioned, the color design is good and, and the visualization for the data, um mm-hmm. And it's also very decent to look at.

Mm-hmm. 

**Researcher:** Yeah. So if you want to, if I want you to rank, like, um, you want to, what, which do you like the most? Uh, which, what, which do you like the most? Yeah.

**P5:** I think, um, I, like I, when I'm playing with the ai, I, uh, I like the, when the AI playing, um, the music, I can see, uh, the output, the, yeah, I can see the feedback and the output and um, [00:04:00] how he react, how he control the parameters. 

**Researcher:** Okay. Uh, what do you like least about the system? 

**P5:** Least about system? Um,

probably, um, for the first time user, and if there we are like the, uh, video tutorial be better. Um mm-hmm. Yeah. And.

Also like for, for the changing the mode. Um, kind of like, uh, if a user with no, uh, computer, like coding experience, maybe changing the, a little bit tricky. Like it feels like you just like, um, change the [00:05:00] mode by directly. Uh, change the road code and if type it like ally, type it like other keyboards or letters still be, could be tricky to, okay.

**Researcher:** Okay. 

**P5:** Yeah. 

**Researcher:** Uh, how did seeing AI predictions on the interface influence your creative decisions?

**P5:** Seeing a DP, um. Actually

influence your 

**Researcher:** Yeah. Seeing AI predictions, the output. 

**P5:** Um, for me, when I saw the data, I, if I don't look at like carefully, I basically have no idea how [00:06:00] AI will. Predict, uh, and how I would respond. My, uh, creative decisions, um, like for the data, like there's many texts, many numbers. Um, for me as like, uh, as a user, maybe just, maybe the user just want to see the, like brief conclusion or something.

This process can be like, can be shown or like, but um, maybe it would be better if it has a brief explanation or something. 

**Researcher:** Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Okay. Uh, do you think the visualizations, for example, lots models, uh, input and output help clarify how the AI perceives and processes data? And which do you think is.

Is the most useful and clear?[00:07:00] 

**P5:** Yeah. So I think the visualization that you can, you can tell, you can easily tell the AI is running, um, in front of you, uh, processing the data you, you create. And you know, ai, you definitely know ai. Uh. Uh, is doing something on your data. And, um, and you can also see the, like, I think, I think a free charts, free charts for the data, uh, is shown on the system.

And, but when I try to read, I just have no idea what the parameter specify for and. Yeah. Uh, although like the [00:08:00] color and the visualization was really quick, um, I think if the parameter will, will, if her would be shown in the list on the list, and maybe it would be better for user to understand how these datas works together.

**Researcher:** Mm-hmm. I, I think you have already answered the next question. Like, yeah. Were there any displays you wish to expect to see that devices is and would that displays seem unnecessary? I think you already answered that, so, yeah. 

**P5:** And also, yeah, maybe like, um, just one thing coming to my mind, it's like when I finish my playing, um, could, uh, could AI like just give a brief.

A little bit feedback like about what style I have play. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Maybe like [00:09:00] what style? Like, um, fast, slow, or like, um, the mood or happy or not happy mm-hmm. Or something. Um, okay. It might, it might build a connection with the, with the user because like when user. Uh, when you, uh, whenever, uh, when you, uh, be ready to play, they probably have a, I already already have a, like, um, an idea of how he will play this piano.

Mm-hmm. Yeah. Okay. 

**Researcher:** Uh, do you have any suggestions in improving the system? For example, are there any specific musical workflows or tasks you would like to interface in the future versions? I think you already, uh, mentioned that as well, like having the conclusion of a AI model. Is there anything else?

**P5:** Question, feedback else? Um.[00:10:00] 

Improve the system.

Yeah. Also, like, uh, it just like, doesn't really matter that much. Uh, maybe you can add, uh, like just, uh, sound effect on clicking. I'm clicking the system clicking on wherever the bottom on the system. Mm-hmm. You mean the just like, it's a, it's like, it's like a music system, right? So a little bit sound like ding, ding, ding.

I click when I click, like just, yeah. 

**Researcher:** When you click and then 

**P5:** like click,

click, click. There'll be some small cell for that. Like this. Oh, 

**Researcher:** oh, okay. 

**P5:** Yeah. Yeah. It doesn't matter that much. Uh, 

**Researcher:** okay. 

**P5:** Yeah. [00:11:00] 

**Researcher:** Um, would you consider using this system in a live or studio context? Why or why not? 

**P5:** Mm.

Okay. So using the system live, I think. I think for me it depends. Like I, I would use the system when I fully, fully, like 200% understand how the system works, how the AI works, and mm-hmm. Uh, if I have a good feedback on the, like the proposal with the ai, um, I would like to use it. I think, I think it is a great idea.

For, with, with the AI technology, uh, other ones. Um, yep. Yeah. And I, [00:12:00] I, if I'm like a performer, I would like to show my audience how AI works with my creation and that would be really cool. 

**Researcher:** Mm-hmm. Okay. Uh, is there anything else you would like to share about your experience? Share my experience. 

**P5:** Um, I think, I think just one thing.

Um, how, how can, how can we just like, improve the experience or for the people who have like, no, like strong music background, um,

like. Is it, it is. The AI will be a, like if, you know, music, AI will be your, your partner, but if you have no background, no knowledge on music, could AI be our tutor or something? Mm-hmm. And then he [00:13:00] ai, so AI will teach us some music or teach you how to play first and then AI will be a partner with you.

There will be a really good experience for the know background user. 

**Researcher:** Mm, this is a, an interesting idea. And, uh, one of the past participants also mentioned that, uh, having a pre-trained model, like using, uh, the real musics, um, yeah. To, to, to train, pre-train a model, and then, uh, for those who are not familiar with the music, and then it could be a better experience for the beginners.

Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay. Okay, and I think this will be our interview.
