# 003-interview

**Researcher:** [00:00:00] Yeah. 

**P3:** Okay. 

**Researcher:** Uh, what were your first impressions of the prototype system? 

**P3:** Prototype as in the whole thing? Um, I think it's very clean. Mm-hmm. Like, you know, what you are looking at. And especially for someone who's new to the system, I think it's pretty easy to understand. Mm-hmm. And play with it. Mm-hmm.

**Researcher:** Thank you. Um, how, and for how long do they learn to use the prototype within the session? Uh, do you think we'll need someone to help you for the first time using this system? 

**P3:** Um, I guess the, in the beginning when there's a tutorial, I think that's quite a sufficient time for you to learn it, like to, to operate the, the instruments and also the system.

I think it's pretty. Pretty easy. Mm-hmm. Um, [00:01:00] I guess it, it was, it, it would be good to have someone to guide you in the beginning. Mm-hmm. And then, yeah. Mm. Then I think afterwards you can definitely do it yourself, I think, to certain extent. Yeah. Mm. Um,

**Researcher:** um, do you think like, um, a tutorial within the, within the website? Mm-hmm. Like the, the prototype. Yeah. Like not a real person guiding you mm-hmm. But instead having a words or text box to guide you through the system bullet, like, uh, do the same as someone helping you? 

**P3:** Yeah, probably. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Because I think, especially now with technology, you definitely, most of the time you would definitely skip someone if there's like, you know, instructions and stuff.

So if there's, um, instructions and tab, step by step to guide you through, I think that's. Also good enough. 

**Researcher:** Mm-hmm. Yeah. Cool. Uh, what do you feel each, you [00:02:00] achieved with this prototype? 

**P3:** What do you feel I achieved with this prototype? Um, okay. Um, I guess if, oh, okay.

**Researcher:** That's a hard question, but, 

**P3:** um, yeah, I guess if you know, like music well enough, I think this would be an interesting mm-hmm. Um, set up to look at and how you can play with it. But yeah, for me, I think it was just fun looking at the colors and how it responds. Yeah. Uhhuh. 

**Researcher:** Uh, what did you like most about the system?

**P3:** Um, I think it's good that it's quite visual. Mm-hmm. Like you can hear the sound, but also like visually it kind of sync in some way, so. Mm-hmm. You [00:03:00] know, it is just nice to look at how, what, how your playing affects the visual, and then if you're a visual and then with the colors and the patterns mm-hmm.

Um. Yeah, it, it's pretty interesting. And then I think just the interface is very clean, so I think it's also very nice, like with the different colors it pops up more. 

**Researcher:** Mm-hmm. 

**P3:** Yeah. 

**Researcher:** Okay. Uh, what do you like least about the system? 

**P3:** Um,

I. Yeah. Okay. Um, I guess in terms of visual, like other than colors, I would, it'd be fun if there's like pictures and stuff as well. I don't know if that's relevant. I don't know, like, like cute, like, you know, like musical notes that come like, you know, um, rather than just like [00:04:00] dots and lines, I guess. Uhhuh.

Yeah, I don't know. Yeah, 

**Researcher:** that's just, okay. So instead of like the, the, the bars, like the, the data here, you are expecting more like visually, um, something other than just thoughts to present at the background, like to make it more colorful, I guess. 

**P3:** Um, I guess, yeah. Mm-hmm. Okay. 

**Researcher:** Okay. I got you. Mm. Okay. Uh, how did seeing AI predictions on the interface influence your creative decisions?

Um,

**P3:** how does it helps, um, visual, visual like influence my decision? Um, I'm, I don't, okay. How does seeing a Predictional interface influence. [00:05:00] Your creative decision mm-hmm. In the interface. Okay. Yeah. So, so it's just the right, the, the right side, the output, output, the, um, it's hard to say because what, how we are playing and what each, each bar represent.

Mm-hmm. It's not very clear on the keyboard, so you don't really know what they're doing with it. Yeah. So it's not, um. As relevant, like, 'cause you don't know what they're predicting and how and that, so then it's, it's difficult to relate to how you will perform. Yeah. So it's, yeah. 

**Researcher:** Mm-hmm. 

**P3:** I got, 

**Researcher:** mm-hmm. Okay.

Uh, do you think the visualizations, like the logs, models, input and output. Help clarify how the AI perceives and pro processes data, and which one [00:06:00] do you think is the most useful and clear one? 

**P3:** Um, I think the imprint output be the clearest in terms of visualization. Mm-hmm. Because it's, it's like, it's like there, it's colorful, right?

Mm-hmm. Um, but in terms of how the AI perceive or process that I'm not. To show like how that visualization, um, help. Okay. Wait, wait, wait, wait. Yeah. What do you think the visualization helped clarify how AI perceive it? No, I don't, I don't, I don't think the visualization actually helped, but I mean, I know that the inputs like my input and then the outputs ai, but other than that, how I process it.

It's not really, I mean, it's, it's not, it's not the main idea, I suppose. Um, [00:07:00] yeah, so I think the input output will be the clearest in terms of logs, model input. I'm not sure I've seen the logs one. I have no idea where it, 

**Researcher:** so just cooking it. Oh, 

**P3:** this 

**Researcher:** one. Okay. So if it does, it helps you to understand how like ai.

Oh, gets your daughter, 

**P3:** I guess. Yeah. If I look, yeah, I guess so. Um, but 

**Researcher:** instead of just royal daughter, I mean 

**P3:** Mm, oh yeah, definitely. 

**Researcher:** Mm-hmm. 

**P3:** Yeah. Okay. Yeah, I know. I get it. Yeah. Okay. Okay. Then in terms of then, I guess log is probably clearer than endpoint output. Mm-hmm. Right? Mm-hmm. Okay. Yeah. And Yeah, definitely.

Okay. Okay. 

**Researcher:** Yeah. Okay. Yeah. Okay. Next question. Um, were there any displays you wish or [00:08:00] expect to see that do not exist? 

**P3:** Um, display.

I remember what I was expecting, so, um.

I 

**Researcher:** Not sure you can say no. 

**P3:** Yeah, no. Okay. 

**Researcher:** Um, yeah, 

**P3:** that this, no. I think, um, may, I don't know. I think maybe, maybe if you are looking at the, like the type of instruments, I don't know, would. If, I don't know if that will affect the, no. Okay. 

**Researcher:** I guess you might just need more times to formulate with the system.

Through the system. Yeah. And then you know what is expected. Mm-hmm. [00:09:00] Yeah. Okay. Uh, then were there any displays or controls that seem unnecessary or confusing? 

**P3:** Um, I don't think so. I think they're pretty. Straightforward. They're pretty straightforward. Yeah. Uhhuh, um, everything's pretty clear mm-hmm. To what you're doing, so.

Mm-hmm. 

**Researcher:** Hmm. Uh, do you have any suggestions in improving the system? Like, for example, are there any specific musical overflows or tasks you would like to the interface to support in the future versions? 

**P3:** Um, I think it would be, mm-hmm. It'd be great. Let's see if you can choose. How, like what instrument the AI used to respond to your playing?

Like if you know something and then maybe that case you can't probably have different instruments playing at the same time rather than the same thing? Or is that like 

**Researcher:** a But [00:10:00] that's not the, the main point. I mean, that's not, uh, um. In the consideration of the, the, the design of the whole system, like mm-hmm.

Because the design, uh, so the system is designed to be. Uh, adapted to all kinds of, uh, musical instrument. Uh oh. Okay. Interfaces like this one, this is a kind of keyboard and it contains 14 dimensions of inputs that, uh, the system could receive. As you can see here, there is 14, but if you could change, if you want to change to another, like a smaller key bot that only, um, inputs like nine dimensions, then it will look totally different.

And then. Or maybe you cannot, cannot choose the instrument that, uh, you give and the AI per, uh, output. Oh, okay. So it's, yeah. 

**P3:** So it depends on what you are giving. Yeah. 

**Researcher:** It depends on what you're giving. Okay. 

**P3:** [00:11:00] Mm. 

**Researcher:** So it, it is designed to work for many kinds of, um, uh, electronic interfaces. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Not just this typical one.

Okay. Yeah. Okay. Okay. Mm-hmm. 

**P3:** I'm 

**Researcher:** using, uh, would you consider using the system in a live or studio context?

**P3:** Live or studio context? Um,

well, if, you know, if I, if I were to be an artist, I guess. It would be fun to look at it in a live situ, you know, live context mm-hmm. Where you, um, interactive. So, or because this is like kind of interactive. Mm-hmm. So it would be fun to see how it would be live in a life, um, context rather than studio.

[00:12:00] Mm-hmm. Yeah. 

**Researcher:** Yeah. Okay. Mm-hmm. Um, is there anything else you would like to share about your experience? Um,

**P3:** um, I think it's,

it'd be fun. It'd be fun if you, if you know, like music and stuff and mm-hmm. If you can like, really play around with it, it would be interesting to, uh. Just look at the performance of the, you know, AI prediction and stuff. Yeah. Yeah. 

**Researcher:** Cool. Okay, then that's everything for interview and you have to finish this.

Okay. Uh, system usability scale, and then we're all done today. Okay? That's 

**P3:** the part of the number 

**Researcher:** 0 0 3.
