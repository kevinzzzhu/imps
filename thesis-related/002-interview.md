# 002-interview

**Researcher:** [00:00:00] What were your first impressions of the prototype system? 

**P2:** High tech. Yeah, it is cool. Uhhuh. 

**Researcher:** Uhhuh. So you feel like the system is very cool to you, like Yeah. Uh, okay. So how and for how long did you learn to use the prototype within the session? 

**P2:** Um, around how many times you teach me? I think it's around five minutes.

Oh, 

**Researcher:** so during the tutorial session, you'll think you fully know how to use the system? 

**P2:** Um, actually most of the 

**Researcher:** things function. Oh yes. Uhhuh, most 

**P2:** of functions I know, but 

**Researcher:** mm-hmm. 

**P2:** But 

**Researcher:** you might need time to be familiar, familiarized with the system. Yeah. Okay. Um, do you think you will need someone to help you for the first time using the system?

**P2:** Yes, I think. Mm-hmm. 

**Researcher:** Mm-hmm. 

**P2:** Yes. 'cause [00:01:00] some of the buttons, I think is not obviously Oh, so I don't know what to click for the next step. Mm-hmm. Yeah. 

**Researcher:** Hmm. Do you think it, is it because of the terms, like the, the phrase used, used, used in the system That is, that is too complicated for, um, beginners like, um, train model or load model, words like that?

**P2:** Um, I don't think. 

**Researcher:** Uh huh. 

**P2:** I don't think it's too complicate Uhhuh. 

**Researcher:** Okay. Uh, what do you feel you, have you achieved with the prototype? 

**P2:** Uh, no bad. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Achieve the prototype? Mm-hmm. Yes. No. That I think, 

**Researcher:** mm-hmm. Okay. Uh, what did you like most about the system? [00:02:00] 

**P2:** Uh, the most about the system?

I think, uh,

**Researcher:** the, the interface is beautiful. Yeah. The 

**P2:** interface is beautiful and some of the, mm-hmm.

**Researcher:** Some of the, 

**P2:** uh,

yes, Kaman is clearly, 

**Researcher:** so what, what types of comments. 

**P2:** Like, for example, change the model Uhhuh and first start a project 

**Researcher:** Uhhuh. But you've said previously like you'll need someone to help you for the first time. 

**P2:** Yes. After doing, after doing 

**Researcher:** the tutorial, yeah. Then it's okay. I [00:03:00] got you. So we'll think it will be better, like for having a tutorial online for someone like, um.

Like, for example, um, having a guide, like, uh, first you have to click this. Mm-hmm. And then in this, in this page, I have something like, uh, after clicking this, click this. Something like that. 

**P2:** Yes. 

**Researcher:** It will be better for us beginners. Yes. Okay. Okay. Uh, what do you like least about the system? 

**P2:** Why you least about the system?

Uhhuh. Um,

let me think. 

**Researcher:** Mm-hmm. Take your time. Okay.[00:04:00] 

**P2:** Can I say? Mm-hmm. 

**Researcher:** You could actually just skip it. Like, oh, pressing here. You could skip the training process. Yeah. Oh, but it won't be here because it is too training at the back end. Okay. 

**P2 (2):** Mm-hmm.

**P2:** But, 

**P2 (2):** mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

**P2:** Um, 

**Researcher:** you could say nothing if you. 

**P2:** Yes. Nothing. 

**Researcher:** Okay. Nothing because I 

**P2:** have no idea about, uh, uhhuh the, these parts. 

**Researcher:** Mm-hmm. Okay. Uh, how did seeing AI predictions on the interface in influence your creative [00:05:00] decisions? 

**P2:** Um, actually I don't think has, is influenced. Yes, it has influenced 

**P2 (2):** Mm. 

**P2:** Or my created pictures.

**P2 (2):** Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. 

**P2:** But maybe, I guess I have no, any creative sections is another corrections 

**P2 (2):** uhhuh, 

**P2:** because I have no idea for create music. Mm-hmm. So, 

**P2 (2):** mm-hmm. 

**Researcher:** Yeah. So like, for example, will you, um, for example, make your, uh, your, your notes like your, your music. Like the, the AI prediction, like the interface to make yours to be like the ai.

Will you do so? No. 

**P2:** Can you repeat it again? 

**Researcher:** Just, just.[00:06:00] 

**P2:** Oh,

oh, so what you mean? It's like when I play the key and you can show the, um, what hand should what I.[00:07:00] 

**Researcher:** Okay. Do you think the visualizations, for example, logs, models, input and output. Help clarify how the AI perceives and processes data, and which one do you think is most clear and useful?

**P2:** Can I use? 

**P2 (2):** Mm-hmm.

**P2:** Oh. But good question. Why I do not use the step two. 

**Researcher:** You use step two. Why? When to, uh, when? When you get into step one, and then after training. Yeah. You remember after training, you go into this, [00:08:00] this training process, and then you go to the right, like you could see the background. Mm-hmm. Oh, this stuff too.

**P2:** Okay. 

**Researcher:** Mm-hmm. 

**P2:** Clarify the process data. 

**Researcher:** Mm-hmm. 

**P2:** Yes. 

**Researcher:** Sorry, sorry. 

**P2:** Help clarify the AI versus the data. 

**Researcher:** Uh, so there is two questions. Mm-hmm. The first one is 

**P2:** 5 

**P2 (2):** 0 2. 

**Researcher:** 5 0 2 5 oh. Yeah. Mm. The first question is, is it useful or not? So do you think, uh, it clarifi? 

**P2:** Yeah. 

**Researcher:** Okay. Then that's the second question. Uhhuh, which one do you think is the most useful?

One? 

**P2:** Most useful? 

**Researcher:** Uhhuh, um. So basically it's this one. So this is the first one. Oh, this is the model? Mm-hmm. The second one. And then this is the first one. Logs. Yeah, the logs. And then the project one means this whole thing [00:09:00] here 

**P2:** in 

**Researcher:** input and output. 

**P2:** Okay. Input and output. The most useful. Um, can you show me this again?

Info and output. 

**Researcher:** So it's basically when you play then the, the graph here. 

**P2:** Oh, okay. I think, uh, what is locks? Sorry? 

**Researcher:** Locks. Is this 

**P2:** okay? Um, I think the locks is the most 

**Researcher:** useful. 

**P2:** Clear, 

**Researcher:** Uhhuh. Clear, 

**P2:** yeah. And as for the most useful, maybe it's, yeah. 

**Researcher:** Okay. Do you have any reasons for, um, uh, why logs is not useful?

**P2:** Um, because I don't know what they 

**Researcher:** present. Yeah. What 

**P2:** they present. Mm-hmm. 

**Researcher:** Got you. Hmm. Okay. [00:10:00] Uh, were there any displays you wish or expect to see that do not exist? Mm-hmm. 

**P2:** Yes. 

**Researcher:** Mm-hmm. So what is the, do you expect to see as 

**P2:** for the lock star, 

**Researcher:** Uhhuh? 

**P2:** Yes. 

**Researcher:** Uhhuh. 

**P2:** Like this one? Uhhuh, I wish to see what they, um, 

**Researcher:** represent.

Yes. In the keyboard? Yeah. In the keyboard. Okay. Mm-hmm. Yep. Okay. Uh, then were there displays or controls that seemed unnecessary or confusing? 

**P2:** Hmm. 

**Researcher:** You could say no if you can't think of any. 

**P2:** Um,

**Researcher:** no. Okay. Okay. Um, just. I want to [00:11:00] check if it's still recording. Okay. Uh, do you have any suggestions for improving the system? For example, are there any specific musical workflows or task, uh, you would like to, like this system to support in the future version? 

**P2 (2):** Uh, um.

**P2:** Okay, like for the next step you need to clip the buttons. 

**P2 (2):** Mm-hmm. 

**P2:** So maybe you can make it more, uh, like bigger. Always some sharing.

Yes. The buttons 

**Researcher:** more obviously. 

**P2:** Yes. Uh, 

**Researcher:** you mean the next step, like having the load model? Yeah. Okay. Mm-hmm. [00:12:00] And also the, the train here to make it bigger and then make it more obvious Yes. That it is the next step. 

**P2:** Yes. And because maybe it's because my habits. Mm-hmm. So I like if I want to do the next step, I wish most of the buttons on the.

Uh, 

**Researcher:** right bottom corner. Yeah. Okay. Got you. Mm-hmm. Uh, would you consider using this system in a live or studio context? Why or why not? 

**P2:** Uh,

can I say I'm not sure? Uhhuh? 

**Researcher:** Yeah. Surely you can, 

**P2:** because process for this Uhhuh experience. Experiments. Oh, you just take a less time. Mm-hmm. And not, um,[00:13:00] 

and actually just like play to,

**P2 (2):** mm-hmm.

**P2:** So it seems like, um, I just have two chance to play the music and change the model. Mm-hmm. So I'm not sure, not familiar with the whole system about whether it can, um, create like the music. Mm-hmm. So, yeah. So I just not sure about Yes. 

**Researcher:** The question. Mm-hmm. Yeah. And the system itself is, is actually like the, the machine learning model itself is actually designed, uh, to train a lot of log files, like to train like 10 or 20 log files.

Mm-hmm. And it will be better. So, yeah. Which is why you feel that, um, it is reasonable that you feel [00:14:00] that this model isn't working as you expected. Yeah. Like, yeah, because it, the limited amount of log files you have, um, in this experiments. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Okay. Um, is there anything else you would like to share about the experience?

Experience? 

**P2:** No. Okay. 

**Researcher:** Thank you. 

**P2:** Thank you. Uh, 

**Researcher:** you'll just have to finish this system. Usability skill and Okay. You'll be done for this experiment. 

Okay.
