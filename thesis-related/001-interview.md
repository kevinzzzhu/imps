# 001-improvisation-interview

**Researcher:** [00:00:00] [00:01:00] [00:02:00] [00:03:00] [00:04:00] [00:05:00] [00:06:00] Yep. I think that will be all for our improvisation [00:07:00] for today. Yep. Um, so, um, I'll be asking you about, um, some questions about, um, the drawings of the whole system. Mm-hmm. And so the first question will be. What were your first impressions of the prototype system? So, well, it's a new one. I have never tried it before.

Yeah. How do you feel about the system? Is it good, is it bad? Like, um, there is still a lot of things to improve.

Um, I think is, um, uh, most, most of them the good. And, uh, maybe, um, [00:08:00] maybe the, um, maybe the, uh, maybe the UI design or the some, uh, some interface can, can be, uh, more colorful or, yeah. Yep. Sure. Um, how, how, and for how long, uh, did you learn to use the prototype within the session?

Um, you mean this session? You, you mean this prototype or Yeah, this prototype. How long do you learn, um, do you think you learn, um, to use to fully, um, know how to use the system? Maybe? Is it simple? Is it hard? Is it too hot? Yeah, maybe simple. I think it's just cost me, uh, cost me, uh, it's straightforward. Two minutes.

Yeah. Yeah. Um, then do you think you will need someone to help you for the first time using the system? Like for example, um, I just [00:09:00] told you this web website and then you open up this website and there is no to tell at all. Do you know, uh, do you think you might need someone's help or if you just discover it by yourself and it is kind of straightforward for you to use?

Uh, I think for the interface, I need, uh, someone, um, uh, someone, uh, tell me how to. Uh, for example, how to create the, um, the log and use a log file to train the model. Yeah, I think I need someone to tell. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Uh, what do you feel you achieved with the prototype

and achieve the prototype? Uh, what do you feel you achieved with the prototype like. Uh, do you feel good like having, uh, a AI with you, like you can, you can create music with that AI that is, uh, you think it really [00:10:00] helps, helps you or, yeah. Yeah, I think it's good and I'm, I think it's, uh, uh, so during my, uh, during my playing, I think it's very immersive.

Yeah, it's an immersive experience, so I can just, um. Just enjoy myself and enjoy the AI all playing with me. 

**P1:** Mm-hmm. Yeah. 

**Researcher:** Uh, what do you most like about the system? Like for the interface itself? Uh, I think it's very clear and, um, very informative, Uhhuh. But you mentioned that you need someone to help you, isn't it?

Yeah, because it is, it is, uh, too many information, so I, oh, yeah. Okay. Okay. Uh, do you think it might be better like having, um, some kind of tutorial for first time user and the interface like tutorial for first time, click this and then click that. Something like that? Uh, yeah. Will help. Yeah. Uh, what do you like the list [00:11:00] about the system?

The list of the system? Mm-hmm. Um, and what's which list? You like the least, like you dislike the most dislike about the system? Yeah. I, I like the system. It's very, uh, for me it's, uh, it's almost, uh, it's a new one. Yeah. Uhhuh. So you think, um, it's good. Yeah. It's okay. Yeah. Um, how did seeing AI predictions on the interface like this mm-hmm.

Um, influence your creative decisions? Um, like having the interface predicting, uh, you can, you can see the next step of ai. Yeah. Uh, does it actually in, uh, influence your, uh, creative decision? Like, will it, will you, will your performance depend on this, uh, interface? Um, I would say I just, [00:12:00] uh, I just want to try, uh, to adjust the different.

Um, knobs and to match with the ai, but mm-hmm. Um, um, that it actually influenced a little bit, right? Yeah. A little bit. Yeah. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Okay. Got it. Um, do you think the visualizations, like the logs, the models and also the input and output, uh, help to clarify how the AI perceives and processes. The data.

Uh, and and which one do you think is the most useful and clear one? Um, you mean the, the logs? Um, like the, to have, to view the, the, uh, how, how you did, how you performed, uh, previously. Mm-hmm. How it collected the data and all the models. Like, um, how it [00:13:00] actually trains or the input and output, like mm-hmm.

Um, visually show you, um, how you perform and how the AI predict, like which one do you think is the most useful and clear one? Um, I think the, um, maybe the, uh, output. Yeah. I think output is very clear. Okay. Yeah. Okay. 

**P1:** Mm-hmm. 

**Researcher:** So, were there any displays, uh, you, you wish to expect or expect to see that do not exist?

**P1:** Mm

mm

I think it's, it's good. Um,

but, um. Yeah. I, I think it's good. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Okay. Yeah, sure. Uh, were there [00:14:00] displays or controls that seemed, um, unnecessary or confusing? Um, maybe the confusing, uh, the confusing maybe. Um, 'cause you know, I, I just, uh, adjust the different knobs, but I, to be honest, I don't, I, uh, I don't know which, which one.

Is, um, which, which, uh, yeah, it's linked to the specific north. Yeah. So I, I just need to, uh, try one by one to mm-hmm. To find out. Yeah. Yeah. That's problem. I think it's a little bit confusing. Yeah. Um, do we have any suggestions for improving the system? Like, for example, are there any specific, um, musical workflows or tasks, uh, you would like the interface to support in the future version?

Like anything to improve that you wish to see? Um, maybe the, uh, maybe the ai, [00:15:00] ai performing. I think it, it can be more, um, mm. You know what I mean? Just more, uh, different style or, um, yeah, just, um, yeah, make it more colorful. Mm-hmm. Yeah. You mean the sound or the interface? Yeah. Uh, the sound. Ah, yeah. Okay. Got it.

So you wish to see like the AI performing in more styles instead of just, uh, playing with one style, like repeating? Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I got you. 

Mm-hmm. 

**Researcher:** So would you consider using this system in a live or studio, studio context? Why or why not? Um, maybe when I feel, uh, tired, I. I will, uh, I like to use the system and to just, just relax, uh, just to relax.

Yeah. So, um, [00:16:00] so I, I'm not sure if I got you. Uh, do you mean like, uh, you will use this system? Uh, you, you will like, pretend that you are a musician, then, uh, you won't be using the system a lot. Like you will use it sometimes, but not for the major production of the music maybe, uh. Uh, if I am a musician, maybe, uh, I will not use, use it.

Yeah. Okay. Yeah. But, uh, for, um, is there any reason for that? Because maybe I think the AI will, uh, not, uh, understand why, you know, my, um, uh, expressions. Yeah. So it's like a chaos thing Yeah. That you won't fully see. Yeah, maybe it will, it won't express your emotions. Yeah. Okay. Got you. Um, is there anything else you would like to share about your experience, [00:17:00] like about the system?

Yeah, it's fine to have nothing to say. Um, us.

**P1:** I think it's good. It's good? Yeah. I think it's good. Yeah. 

It, it. Cool. Yep. Thank you so much. And, um, the last thing to do is to, um, uh, finish a system, US usability skill. Mm-hmm. And after completing this, and this is everything for our study today, and thank you so much. Uh, the participation number is 0 0 1, so you could Oh, sure.

Okay. 0 0 1 date. That's the first half of May.

Yep. Yep. You could fill up the, uh, [00:18:00] the questions.

Too much

learn use system very quickly.

Most learn. Mm.[00:19:00] 

**Researcher:** Okay. Thank you so much. Thank you. And this will be all for our study. Okay. Thank you. Thank you.
