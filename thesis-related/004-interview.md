# 004-interview

**Researcher:** [00:00:00] Okay. What were your first impressions of the protest system? 

**P4:** Uh, I think it is pretty good. It is, uh, pretty clear uhhuh, uh, I mean, for a person with no musical background like me, I think it is, uh, pretty straightforward. 

**Researcher:** Okay. Uh, how and for how long did you learn to use the prototype within the session?

Uh, do you think you, you will need someone to help you for the first time using the system? 

**P4:** Uh, I think I, I learned the, the protesting in, uh, about five minutes and, uh, and, uh, I think if, if I was, if I wasn't help for the first time, then uh, I might take longer, but I think I, I, I could still figure out how to use it, uh, by the end.

I like, like, uh. If someone helped me, then it'll probably [00:01:00] take five minutes. But then if I was on my own, I'll probably take like 10 minutes. 

**Researcher:** Okay. Uh, how do you feel you achieved with the prototype? 

**P4:** Uh, I mean, I, I feel like I, uh, the, the model wasn't particularly well, but, uh, I think it was because, uh, mainly because, uh, like I have, I don't have a.

Piano background. So, so, so I was just basically just, uh, playing randomly. Mm-hmm. Okay. 

**Researcher:** Uh, what do you like most about the system?

**P4:** I think it's very, uh, it's very, how do I say this? It's very interesting. Uh, it's very, uh, like very intriguing and, uh, yeah, it, [00:02:00] it just looks fun. Mm-hmm. Yeah. 

**Researcher:** Uh, what do you like least about the system? 

**P4:** Uh, I don't know. I think probably, uh. I can, I can, I can. I can't really say. I mean, I can't really say. Yeah, no problem.

**Researcher:** Uh, how did seeing AI predictions on the interface influence your creative decisions? 

**P4:** Uh, I mean, the output 

**Researcher:** of the graph here. 

**P4:** Oh, I think, uh, I think it, it looks, uh, like. It looks very interesting for sure. But, uh, I mean, I, I think I, I, I didn't really connect the, the output with like what, [00:03:00] what I was playing or the AI was playing.

Mm-hmm. I think, I think you probably need some musical background to understand. 

**Researcher:** Okay. 

**P4:** Hmm. 

**Researcher:** Uh, do you think the visualizations, like for example, uh, logs, models, input and output, help clarify how the AI perceives and processes data and which one do you think is the most clear and useful? Yeah, 

**P4:** I think, I think definitely the, the visualization, the visualizations are very helpful 'cause uh, they kind of.

Uh, allowed me to better understand what the system was doing. Mm-hmm. And, uh,

I think the comparing

like the, the visual isolating, comparing my output and DIS output was, uh, [00:04:00] pretty, was probably the most useful. Mm-hmm. 

**Researcher:** Okay. Uh, were there any displays you wish or expect to see that do not exist? Were there displays or controls that seems, uh, unnecessary or confusing?

**P4:** Uh, I think overall, not really. 'cause I think, I think the system is, looks pretty, pretty concise and, uh mm-hmm. Yeah. I, it, it's. Alright. I think it's, yeah. 

**Researcher:** Yeah. Yeah. It's good. Okay. Uh, do you have any suggestions in improving the system? Like, for example, are there any specific musical workflows or tasks you would like to the, uh, interface to support in the future versions?

Uh,[00:05:00] 

**P4:** uh, I can't really say. I think, uh, maybe you need more time to be 

**Researcher:** Yes. To familiar with this system. Yes, definitely. Yeah. Okay. Uh, would you consider using the system in a live or studio context? Why or why not? Mm. 

**P4:** Like. Of this specific project. If I was like, uh, like doing like live music, then I think that, I think the system would definitely be helpful, Uhhuh.

'cause it would kind of, uh, uh,

we kind of like, uh, like save time or stuff, I guess. Mm-hmm. Yeah, I think, I think it, it definitely could be helpful. Mm-hmm. 

**Researcher:** Okay. [00:06:00] Uh, is there anything else you would like to share about your experience? 

**P4:** Uh, it's pretty slow. Yeah. If anything. I think just, uh, it was pretty fun. Mm-hmm. Even though I didn't know what, what I was doing.

All good. Okay. Uh, 

**Researcher:** okay. Complete this system usability skill and we'll all be done for today. Check.
